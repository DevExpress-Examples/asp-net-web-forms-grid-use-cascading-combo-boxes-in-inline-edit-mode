# How to use cascading comboboxes in an inline edit mode


<p>This demo illustrates a server-side technique of using cascading comboboxes in an inline editor. Four comboboxes are used for editing four database fields. The second combobox' set of possible values is based on the selected value of the first combo, the third combobox' possible values is based on the selected values of the first and the second comboboxes and so forth. The demo uses the Update panel to avoid an update of the entire page.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong><br />
